          <h2 id="title">Starry Night</h2>
          <p>
            Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890), a Dutch Post-Impressionist artist, stands as one of the most iconic figures in the history 
            of Western art. His distinct style and innovative techniques had a profound impact on the trajectory of art, bridging the gap 
            between Impressionism and modern art movements. Van Gogh's art is characterized by his bold and vibrant use of color, his thick
            and textured brushwork known as impasto, and his deeply emotional approach to his subjects. <br><br> His paintings go beyond mere 
            visual representation; they serve as windows into his inner world, expressing his own struggles, emotions, and perspectives.
            Throughout his life, van Gogh battled mental health issues and periods of intense emotional turmoil. These personal struggles 
            found their way into his art, resulting in pieces that are charged with raw energy and a poignant sense of authenticity. 
            Whether depicting the serene beauty of a starry night in "The Starry Night" or the introspective intensity of self-portraits 
            like "Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear," van Gogh's works are imbued with a unique blend of visual dynamism and emotional depth. <br><br>
            Despite facing financial difficulties and limited recognition during his lifetime, his legacy has since grown exponentially. 
            His innovative use of color and brushwork, coupled with his ability to convey complex emotions through his art, have solidified 
            his place as an artistic visionary whose influence continues to resonate with artists and art enthusiasts worldwide.

          <p>
            Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (1571-1610) was a groundbreaking Italian Baroque painter whose artistic 
            innovations left an indelible mark on the world of art. Caravaggio's approach to painting was marked by his unprecedented use of light and shadow, 
            a technique known as chiaroscuro. This technique not only added a heightened sense of realism to his works but also created a strong contrast 
            between light and darkness, effectively drawing the viewer's attention to the focal points of his compositions. <br> His subjects, often depicted in stark, 
            dramatic lighting, seemed to emerge from the darkness with a striking sense of physical presence. 
            Caravaggio's ability to capture the human form with remarkable precision, whether in religious scenes or everyday situations, showcased his deep 
            understanding of anatomy and his keen observational skills. <br><br><br>
            Caravaggio's art was notable not only for its technical mastery but also for its emotional depth. His paintings often depicted intense moments of human 
            experience, from religious scenes like "The Supper at Emmaus" to genre paintings like "The Cardsharps." <br> Through his work, Caravaggio explored 
            themes of passion, suffering, and mortality, inviting viewers to contemplate the complexities of life and spirituality. However, 
            his personal life was also marked by controversy and turmoil. He was known for his irascible temperament and was frequently involved in brawls 
            and legal disputes, adding an element of drama to his own story that mirrored the intensity of his art.
